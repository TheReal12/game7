# 3D 256
Based on [Baiqiang's 3D 2048](http://baiqiang.github.io/2048-3d/).

A variant on 3D 2048. [Play it here!](http://gold5472.github.io/3d-256/)

## Changes from regular 2048game

* 3D 3x3x3 grid
* Special tiles

### New special tiles (from 3D 2048)

There are 'bonus' tiles. They have different colors from normal tiles and can only be merged with same one. Both tiles will disappear after being merged.

It's not a really bonus tile. I added them just to increase difficulty. Since the 3D version has more tiles and more directions, it's much easier than the normal version if there's no traverse. Do you have any good idea?

## How to play

Use your arrow keys to move the tiles, R(or Q) and F(or E) to move ahead and back, G key to rotate, hold 1, 2 or 3 to hide layers, ESC and 0 to restart. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!.
